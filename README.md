# Sign Language Translation Tool using OpenCV

This project is a beginner-friendly **Sign Language Translation Tool** built using **Python**, **OpenCV**, and **TensorFlow/Keras**. It captures live video from your webcam, detects hand signs, and translates them into corresponding alphabets in real-time.

---

## Features

- Real-time sign language detection
- Uses OpenCV for live video and image processing
- Trained deep learning model for hand sign classification
- Simple and efficient code structure

---

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x** – Programming language
- **OpenCV** – Image capturing and preprocessing
- **TensorFlow / Keras** – Model training and prediction
- **NumPy** – Array and matrix operations
- **Jupyter Notebook** – For model training & experiments (if used)

---

Future Improvements

GUI with Tkinter or PyQt

Voice output for translated text

Support for full word & sentence detection

Multilingual support

Usage

1. Prepare Dataset (If training yourself):

Collect images of hand signs (A–Z) and organize them in separate folders.

Preprocess the images and train the model using a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network).

Save the trained model as .h5 file.



2. Run the Tool:

Make sure your webcam is connected.

Execute the Python script:

python sign_language_translation.py

The camera feed will open, and you’ll see the hand sign detection in real time.

Show a hand sign in front of the webcam to see the corresponding alphabet printed on screen.



3. Model Prediction:

The captured image is preprocessed (resized, grayscale etc.).

The image is fed to the trained model.

The model predicts the letter corresponding to the hand sign.



4. Result Display:

The detected alphabet will be displayed on the screen with the video feed.

You can continue showing different signs to translate them one by one

Conclusion

This project showcases how computer vision and deep learning can be used to build a meaningful tool that bridges communication gaps for the hearing and speech-impaired. It's a great starting point for anyone interested in assistive technology or AI-powered interaction systems.
