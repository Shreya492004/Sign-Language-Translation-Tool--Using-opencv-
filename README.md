# Sign Language Translation Tool using OpenCV

This project is a beginner-friendly **Sign Language Translation Tool** built using **Python**, **OpenCV**, and **TensorFlow/Keras**. It captures live video from your webcam, detects hand signs, and translates them into corresponding alphabets in real-time.

---

## Features

- Real-time sign language detection
- Uses OpenCV for live video and image processing
- Trained deep learning model for hand sign classification
- Simple and efficient code structure

---

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x** – Programming language
- **OpenCV** – Image capturing and preprocessing
- **TensorFlow / Keras** – Model training and prediction
- **NumPy** – Array and matrix operations
- **Jupyter Notebook** – For model training & experiments (if used)

---
